# This code is cribbed from

# Updated Apr 17, 2011 by Graham.Dumpleton@gmail.com
#
# The use of signals to restart a daemon process could also be employed in a mechanism which automatically detects changes to any Python modules or dependent files. This could be achieved by creating a thread at startup which periodically looks to see if file timestamps have changed and trigger a restart if they have.
# 
# Example code for such an automatic restart mechanism which is compatible with how mod_wsgi works is shown below.
